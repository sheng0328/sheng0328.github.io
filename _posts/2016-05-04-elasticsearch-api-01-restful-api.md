## Developer-Friendly, RESTful API

Elasticsearch is API driven. Almost any action can be performed using a simple RESTful API using JSON over HTTP. Client libraries are available for many programming languages.

* Check your cluster, node, and index health, status, and statistics
* Administer your cluster, node, and index data and metadata
* Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) and search operations against your indexes
* Execute advanced search operations such as paging, sorting, filtering, scripting, aggregations, and many others
