## Executing Aggregations

The aggregations framework helps provide aggregated data based on a search query. It is based on simple building blocks called aggregations, that can be composed in order to build complex summaries of the data.

## Structuring Aggregations

The following snippet captures the basic structure of aggregations:

```js
"aggregations" : {
    "<aggregation_name>" : {
        "<aggregation_type>" : {
            <aggregation_body>
        }
        [,"meta" : {  [<meta_data_body>] } ]?
        [,"aggregations" : { [<sub_aggregation>]+ } ]?
    }
    [,"<aggregation_name_2>" : { ... } ]*
}
```

This example groups all the accounts by state, and then returns the top 10 (default) states sorted by count descending (also default):

```js
POST localhost:9200/bank/_search?pretty
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "group_by_state": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "state"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In SQL, the above aggregation is similar in concept to:

```sql
SELECT state, COUNT(*) FROM bank GROUP BY state ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
```

Response:

```js
"hits" : {
    "total" : 1000,
    "max_score" : 0.0,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "group_by_state" : {
      "buckets" : [ {
        "key" : "al",
        "doc_count" : 21
      }, {
        "key" : "tx",
        "doc_count" : 17
      }, {
        "key" : "id",
        "doc_count" : 15
      }, {
        "key" : "ma",
        "doc_count" : 15
      }, {
        "key" : "md",
        "doc_count" : 15
      }, {
        "key" : "pa",
        "doc_count" : 15
      }, {
        "key" : "dc",
        "doc_count" : 14
      }, {
        "key" : "me",
        "doc_count" : 14
      }, {
        "key" : "mo",
        "doc_count" : 14
      }, {
        "key" : "nd",
        "doc_count" : 14
      } ]
    }
  }
}
```

Building on the previous aggregation, this example calculates the average account balance by state (again only for the top 10 states sorted by count in descending order):

```js
POST localhost:9200/bank/_search?pretty
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "group_by_state": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "state"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "average_balance": {
          "avg": {
            "field": "balance"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Building on the previous aggregation, letâ€™s now sort on the average balance in descending order:

```js
POST localhost:9200/bank/_search?pretty
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "group_by_state": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "state",
        "order": {
          "average_balance": "desc"
        }
      },
      "aggs": {
        "average_balance": {
          "avg": {
            "field": "balance"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates how we can group by age brackets (ages 20-29, 30-39, and 40-49), then by gender, and then finally get the average account balance, per age bracket, per gender:

```js
POST localhost:9200/bank/_search?pretty
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "group_by_age": {
      "range": {
        "field": "age",
        "ranges": [
          {
            "from": 20,
            "to": 30
          },
          {
            "from": 30,
            "to": 40
          },
          {
            "from": 40,
            "to": 50
          }
        ]
      },
      "aggs": {
        "group_by_gender": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "gender"
          },
          "aggs": {
            "average_balance": {
              "avg": {
                "field": "balance"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
